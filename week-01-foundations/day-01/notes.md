# Day 03 — Notes

## 1. What I Practiced Today
- For loops and while loops
- Finding max numbers in an array
- Understanding iteration and indexes

## 2. What I Struggled With
- Remembering when to use map vs forEach
- Mixing up i++ and ++i in loops
- Forgetting to reset variables

## 3. What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- for...of is good for reading values
- Traditional for loops are good when I need the index
- map returns a new array; forEach does not

## 4. What I Want to Improve Tomorrow
- Practice more array methods
- Try 2 extra loop exercises for confidence
