# Day 01 — Notes

## 1. What I Practiced Today
- Basic string manipulation
- Reversing a string
- Checking whether a value or character exists in a collection (.includes())
- Understanding how functions can be reused

## 2. What I Struggled With
- Writing reusable functions
- Knowing where to place the return statement inside a loop

## 3. What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- A return inside a loop is used when I want to stop immediatelly after finding the first matching value
- A return after the loop is used when I want to check all values first and then provide a final result 

## 4. What I Want to Improve Tomorrow
- Strengthening my understanding of control flow in JavaScript
- Writing more reusable functions
