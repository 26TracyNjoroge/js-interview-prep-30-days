# JavaScript Interview Prep - 30 Days
This repository documents my daily progress as I strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, improve my problem-solving skills, and prepare for real front-end developer interviews.

I created this repo to stay disciplined, track growth publicly, and build confidence through consistent practice.

## Goal of this repository
I want to become a strong front-end developer who:

- Understands core JavaScript deeply
- Can solve interview-style problems with confidence
- Can explain concepts clearly and think logically
- Practices consistently and intentionally
- Builds the problem-solving mindset needed for hiring tests
